    <p>HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure and content of a web page by using a system of elements and tags. These elements define various parts of the page such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more..</p>

    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to define the presentation of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) documents. It controls the layout, formatting, and appearance of web pages, allowing developers to separate the content of a webpage from its design. CSS works by associating styling rules with HTML elements, specifying how they should be displayed in the browser.</p>

    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. Unlike HTML and CSS, which focus on defining the structure and presentation of web content, JavaScript empowers developers to manipulate the content, respond to user interactions, and modify the behavior of web pages in real-time. JavaScript code can be embedded directly into HTML documents or included externally as separate files.</p>
